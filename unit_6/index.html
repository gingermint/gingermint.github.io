                    <h1>Contributing to nature conservation in Australia</h1>
                    <p>We are an independent, not for profit, charitable trust with the sole purpose of contributing to nature conservation in Australia. We believe that private individuals and private sector organisations can make a very major contribution to nature conservation in Australia, both supplementing and complementing the public reserve system.<br>We believe that there is no single right model for conservation. Rather, there are many right models that, working together, can make a very real difference to protecting the truly unique flora and fauna of this great and ancient continent.</p>

                    <p>To date, South Endeavour Trust currently owns and manages thirteen conservation reserves focusing on four areas of great conservation need, each of which has extraordinarily diverse biodiversity values. These are: Northeastern New South Wales; the endangered rainforests of the Atherton Tablelands; and the intersection of the Wet Tropics and Cape York bioregions in Far North Queensland.</p>

                    <a href="#"><h3>Our Founder</h3></a>
                    <p>Simon Marais, the Founder of South Endeavour Trust died in February 2015 after a short but valiant battle with a very aggressive cancer. One of Simon's major concerns as he contemplated his mortality was to ensure that South Endeavour Trust would endure for what he described as "a thousand years".</p>
