				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				<h2>We are an independent, not for profit, charitable trust with the sole purpose of contributing to nature conservation in Australia.</h2>
				
				<p>We believe that private individuals and private sector organisations can make a very major contribution to nature conservation in Australia, both supplementing and complementing the public reserve system. We believe that there is no single right model for conservation. Rather, there are many right models that, working together, can make a very real difference to protecting the truly unique flora and fauna of this great and ancient continent.</p><br>

				
				<p>South Endeavour's portfolio now covers a string of reserves across northern NSW from the coast to the far western desert protecting an incredible array of endangered ecological communities, actively used habitat for many endangered species and, most recently, some of the most important water bird breeding sites in the state.</p>

				<h3>Our Founder</h3>
				<h2>Simon Marais</h2>
				<h4>1955 - 2015</h4>
				<p>Simon Marais, the Founder of South Endeavour Trust died in February 2015 after a short but valiant battle with a very aggressive cancer. While best known as a leading investment manager, conservation was Simon's passion and South Endeavour Trust stands as a legacy to this passion.</p><br>

				<p>One of Simon's major concerns as he contemplated his mortality was to ensure that South Endeavour Trust would endure for what he described as "a thousand years". We had many discussions as to his wishes for the future in the grim months before his death and we have put in place funding arrangements to ensure that South Endeavour will endure in perpetuity.</p>

				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<h2>Our objectives are threefold</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>To make the greatest possible contribution to nature conservation that we can, which often means doing things that others cannot or will not do.</li>
					<li>To manage our conservation reserves as well as we practically can.</li>
					<li>To ensure that we build and maintain a sufficient capital base such the annual income from that capital is sufficient to meet our management costs in perpetuity.</li>
				</ul>
