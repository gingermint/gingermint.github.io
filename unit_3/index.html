				<h2>We believe that private individuals and private sector organisations can make a very major contribution to nature conservation in Australia, both supplementing and complementing the public reserve system.</h2>
				<br>
				<p>We believe that there is no single right model for conservation. Rather, there are many right models that, working together, can make a very real difference to protecting the truly unique flora and fauna of this great and ancient continent.</p>

				<h2>Our Trust</h2>

				<p>We actively seek to work in partnership with others to make the greatest possible contribution that we can to conserving the unique natural values of our great and ancient land.</p>

				<h2>Our Objectives are threefold</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>To make the greatest possible contribution to nature conservation that we can, which often means doing things that others cannot or will not do.</li>
					<li>To manage our conservation reserves as well as we practically can.</li>
					<li>To ensure that we build and maintain a sufficient capital base such the annual income from that capital is sufficient to meet our management costs in perpetuity.</li>
