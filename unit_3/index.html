			<h2>Contributing to nature conservation in Australia</h2>

		<p>We are an independent, not for profit, charitable trust with the sole purpose of contributing to nature conservation in Australia. We believe that private individuals and private sector organisations can make a very major contribution to nature conservation in Australia, both supplementing and complementing the public reserve system. We believe that there is no single right model for conservation. Rather, there are many right models that, working together, can make a very real difference to protecting the truly unique flora and fauna of this great and ancient continent</p>
