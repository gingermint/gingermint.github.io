				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				<h2>We are an independent, not for profit, charitable trust with the sole purpose of contributing to nature conservation in Australia.</h2>
				
				<p>We believe that private individuals and private sector organisations can make a very major contribution to nature conservation in Australia, both supplementing and complementing the public reserve system. We believe thatthere is no single right model for conservation. Rather, there are many right models that, working together, can make a very real difference to protecting the truly unique flora and fauna of this great and ancient continent.</p><br>

				<p>South Endeavour Trust was established by Simon Marais in 2007 as an independent, not for profit, charitable trust with the sole purpose of contributing to nature conservation in Australia. Unfortunately, Simon died in February 2015 after a short but valiant battle with a very aggressive cancer. One of Simon's major concerns as he contemplated his mortality was to ensure that South Endeavour Trust would endure for what he described as "a thousand years".</p>

				<h3>Our Objectives are Threefold</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To make the greatest possible contribution to nature conservation that we can, which often means doing things that others cannot or will not do.</li>
					<li>To manage our conservation reserves as well as we practically can.</li>
					<li>To ensure that we build and maintain a sufficient capital base such the annual income from that capital is sufficient to meet our management costs in perpetuity.</li>
